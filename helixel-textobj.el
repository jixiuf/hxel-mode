With positive COUNT, move forward COUNT levels.  With negative COUNT,

If NAME-GROUP is an integer, only match blocks with the same name
captured by that regex group in both BEGIN-RE and END-RE (e.g., 1 for
org-mode #+begin_foo / #+end_foo).  The two regexps must capture the
block name in the same group number.

If NAME-GROUP is nil, use counter-based balancing: each BEGIN-RE match
increments the counter, each END-RE match decrements it.  When the
counter reaches zero, a matching pair has been found.  When BEGIN-RE
equals END-RE (e.g., markdown ``` fences), each match simply toggles
the counter.

Sets `match-data' on success so callers can extract the delimiter
bounds via `match-beginning' / `match-end'.

Returns 0 on success, or (* dir remaining) when not all levels found."
