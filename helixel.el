;;; Commentary:
;;
;; helixel-mode is a minor mode that provides modal editing inspired by
;; the Helix editor.  It loads helixel-common (core state machine and
;; keymaps), helixel-search (isearch-backed search), and helixel-textobj
;; (text objects).


;;; Code:

(require 'helixel-action)
(require 'helixel-common)
(require 'helixel-search)
(require 'helixel-textobj)

(provide 'helixel)
