# Emacs Elisp Debugging Skill

## Core Principles

### 1. Reproduce in batch mode first
```bash
emacs -batch -l package --eval "(package-initialize)" \
  -l helixel-test.el \
  --eval "(ert-run-tests-batch-and-exit 'test-name)"
```
Batch mode isolates: no interactive state, no `.emacs.d` customizations, deterministic output.

### 2. Trace the data flow end-to-end
For every bug, draw the complete chain from trigger → intermediate state → final result.
The bug is always at one step in the chain.

### 3. The test-isolation binary search
When a test passes in isolation but fails in the full suite:
1. Run just the failing tests → confirm they pass alone
2. Run failing tests + their alphabetical neighbors → find the breaking range
3. Use `set-match-data nil`, `(setq global-var nil)` guards to eliminate state leakage

Key insight: `save-match-data` **preserves** stale data as integers, which
`set-match-data` then interprets in the current buffer. Prefer `(set-match-data nil)`
to clear match data entirely.

### 4. Add `message` probes to narrow the gap
Put `(message "TAG: key1=%S key2=%S" val1 val2)` at each step of the flow.
Run in batch, grep for the TAG. Compare working vs broken scenarios.
In batch mode output, look for the `Test X condition:` line which shows
the full `should` failure with `:form`, `:value`, `:explanation`.

### 5. Check the "invisible" state
Things that silently cause wrong behavior:
- **Stale match data**: `(match-beginning 0)` returns integers from killed buffers
- **`post-command-hook` not firing**: In tests, `insert` is a function, not a command
- **`(when nil ...)`**: The most common "nothing happens" bug — a guard becomes nil unexpectedly
- **Buffer-local vs global**: `defvar` is global, `defvar-local` is per-buffer. Tests with `with-temp-buffer` clean up locals but not globals.
- **`this-command-keys-vector` in non-command context**: Returns wrong or empty vector

### 6. Understand `vconcat` on a single list argument
```elisp
(vconcat '([1] [2] [3]))  → [[1] [2] [3]]   ; vector of vectors (preserves structure)
(vconcat '("a" "b" "c"))  → ["a" "b" "c"]   ; vector of strings
(vconcat '(1 2 3))        → [1 2 3]          ; errors if elements aren't sequences
```
The single list argument is treated as a SEQUENCE whose elements become
the result vector's elements. No flattening occurs.

### 7. Test the real path, not a simulation
If the real code uses `post-command-hook` and `this-command-keys-vector`,
the test must either:
- Use `execute-kbd-macro` (but it may not trigger post-command-hook in batch), or
- The architecture should be redesigned so the testable path IS the real path

## Common Bugs by Symptom

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Check |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| "Nothing happens" | `(when nil ...)` guard, empty string, error caught silently | Add message before/after every guard |
| Wrong text inserted | `buffer-substring` captures cursor-moved-over text | Check `extract-self-insert-text` result |
| Wrong position | Stale match data, wrong `sel-ctx` kind | Print `(match-beginning 0)`, `(use-region-p)`, sel-ctx at each step |
| Tests pass, interactive fails | `post-command-hook` timing, test simulates differently | Compare test's manual key-push vs real hook recording |
| First key lost | `pop` on wrong list element, sentinel transition | Print raw list before/after each mutation |
| Extra key in result | Entry key recorded, control char included | Check `this-command` in hook, check `key-binding` for self-insert |

## Sentinel State Machine Pattern
When using sentinels to track recording state:
```
nil        → not recording (guard: (when val ...) skips)
'pending   → waiting for first real event (skip entry event)
(list nil) → recording, empty (non-nil so guard fires)
(list A B) → recording, has data
```
The transition `'pending` → `nil` is WRONG because `nil` makes the guard skip.
Always transition to a truthy value.

## Key Functions for Probing

```elisp
;; What command just ran?
(message "CMD: %s keys=%S" this-command (this-command-keys-vector))

;; What is the match data?
(message "MATCH: mb=%S me=%S buf=%S"
         (match-beginning 0) (match-end 0)
         (and (match-data) (marker-buffer (car (match-data)))))

;; Is the region active?
(message "REGION: active=%S beg=%d end=%d"
         (use-region-p) (region-beginning) (region-end))

;; What's in the edit transaction?
(message "TX: op=%S sel=%S payload=%S"
         (helixel-edit-op tx) (helixel-edit-sel tx) (helixel-edit-payload tx))
```

## Debugging the Recording Path (insert-mode)

The recording path has 4 stages. Probe each:

```
1. Entry:  insert-keys='pending, sel-ctx=?
2. Post-command-hook: pending→(nil) transition, skip entry key?
3. Each productive key: push key-vector onto list?
4. Exit:   vconcat(nreverse(butlast(list)))? extract text? cursor-offset?
```

If any stage produces unexpected output, the final `:text` payload will be wrong.
